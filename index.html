    <h1><u>Version Control Systems</u></h1>
    <p>Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps record changes to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code.<br>
       Version control enables multiple people to simultaneously work on a single project.<br>
       Each person edits his or her own copy of the files and chooses when to share those changes with the rest of the team.<br>
       Thus, temporary or partial edits by one person do not interfere with another person's work.
